# **UFOs**

## **Overview of the analysis:**
In this exercise, we created a table to organize UFO data with the ability to dynamically filter data on the following criteria: date, city, state, country, and shape and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. 

## **Resources:**
* Data Sources: data.js
* Languages: JavaScript ES6+, HTML, CSS
* Tools: D3, Bootstrap

## **Results:**

A search can be done using the date, city, state, country, and shape.

## **Summary:**
**Drawbacks:** The filter fields are great but it would be better if it was a drop down list of the options that were available to ensure that the user is selecting from the avaialble data points.

**Additional Recommendations:** 
* Have a way to be able to select multiple criteria in the filter fields
* Create multiple pages for the entry results by grouping by 25 results at a time.
* Have a way to sort the data by the header row titles in ascending or descending order.
