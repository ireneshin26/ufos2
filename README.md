# **UFOs**

## **Overview of the analysis:**
In this exercise, we created a table to organize UFO data with the ability to dynamically filter data on the following criteria: date, city, state, country, and shape and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. 

## **Resources:**
* Data Sources: data.js
* Languages: JavaScript ES6+, HTML, CSS
* Tools: D3, Bootstrap

## **Results:**

To filter the UFO sighting data, type the desired search criteria into the specified search fields: Date, City, State, Country, Shape. Example placeholder entires are visible in each of the fields to guide user responses and enter information in the correct format. For example, the "Enter Date" field take searches in a numbered format, such as 1/7/2010. The table will dynamically update and return results after entering search fields. If no matches are found, the table will be empty.

Below is an example of one filtering scenaria for: 
* Date: 1/1/2010
* City: El Cajon
* State: CA
* Country: US
* Shape: Triangle

## **Summary:**
**Drawbacks:** The filter fields are great but it would be better if it was a drop down list of the options that were available to ensure that the user is selecting from the avaialble data points.

**Additional Recommendations:** 
* Have a way to be able to select multiple criteria in the filter fields
* Create multiple pages for the entry results by grouping by 25 results at a time.
* Have a way to sort the data by the header row titles in ascending or descending order.

Your written analysis has great structure and formatting. The purpose is well defined. You did not go into detail about how to conduct a search on your webpage. You were not able to identify a drawback of the webpage. You made a recommendation instead of stating a drawback. You made two additional recommendations.
